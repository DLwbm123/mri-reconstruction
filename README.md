* Reconstruction with context (coronal, sagital, ventral sections or patient history, genetics)
* Reconstruction with few samples (learned priors, sparse bases, compressed sampling)
* (Learn to) iteratively pick the best points to samples that minimise uncertainty and maximise the accuracy of reconstruction.
